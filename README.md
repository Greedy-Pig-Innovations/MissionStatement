# MissionStatement
At Greedy Pig Innovations we focus on self-improvement, self-recreation, and self-destruction in that order.
We've been working together creating projects since 2017, however as we were not so smart we didnt store any of them anywhere.
We intend to continue pushing new projects as grow as developers and expose ourselves to new technologies.
So far we are developing our skills in React, and bootstrap, making a front end application to the Monster Hunter World API, next project would be making our own API.
Stay on the lookout for our new projects!
